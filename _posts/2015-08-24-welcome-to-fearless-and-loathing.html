<p>Dear readers,</p>

<p>I founded Fearless and Loathing in 2009 to be an independent source of news for Oberlin College and as such established F+L as an LLC.</p>

<p>Last year’s editorial staff decided to charter as a student organization, intending to better serve the Oberlin student body.</p>

<p>We’ve handled this split like a project fork. I’ve given the former editors of F+L a complete copy of F+L’s filesystem and database, and I wish them well on their endeavor, found at disdainfulyouth.com, on Facebook at facebook.com/disdainfulyouth, and on Twitter @disdainfulyouth.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, fearlessandloathing.com L.L.C. remains active and independent from Oberlin College. Check the new About section for more on the new direction.</p>

<p>Love,<br />
David Edward Clark ‘12, Founder and Owner</p>
